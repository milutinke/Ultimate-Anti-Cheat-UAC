Description:
	About the project:
		This is community project which has been started by Milutinke (ByM) in early 2018 based on Ilham Sakura's anti cheat.
		The goal of the project was to extend the life of Counter-Strike 1.6 game by providing
		the server owners/community with means to get rid of the cheaters.
		I will not provide any support or updated to the project anymore, I am leaving it to your hands
		as the community.
		I hope that someone will improve it in the future.

	About the pack itself:
		This Anti Cheat Pack aims to help the server owners/communities to get rid of the cheaters in most server 
		friendly way and to protect the server from various exploits and malicious attacks.
		This Anti Cheat Pack consists of multiple plugins and modules listed below, providing layered protection
		form cheats and exploits.
		This may not be able to filter all cheaters 100% but it will filter at least 99% of them.
		There will always be that 1% percent, but in end, that 1% percent cannot make too much bad of experience
		for other players as 99% can.
		This pack has been tested and has worked well on Legendary Community and Heavy Team servers.
		Few add-ons are added after the test have been completed, they are located at Optional - Not tested folder,
		use them at your own risk.

	NOTE: Use ReAimDetector instead of default AIM detection (Default AIM Detection is limited and not good and it is disabled by default).
	NOTE: You might be requiered to tweak the settings depending on your server version
